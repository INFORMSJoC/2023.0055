Benchmarks
==========

This page lists benchmark results obtained by recent versions of the PyVRP package and reference VRP solvers.
See the :doc:`benchmarking instructions <../dev/benchmarking>` for how these benchmarks are run. 

PyVRP
-----

The table below contains the benchmark results obtained by each new significant version of PyVRP.
The reported values represent the percentage gap to the best-known solutions at the time of the benchmark, averaged over ten seeds.
These best-known solutions are tracked in the ``PyVRP/Instances`` repository - see the :doc:`benchmarking instructions <../dev/benchmarking>` for details.
The configuration files used for benchmarking are ``configs/cvrp.toml`` (for CVRP) and ``configs/vrptw.toml`` (for VRPTW and PC-VRPTW).
